# ChampionDex

**ChampionDex** is a simple web page that fetches and displays the playable characters from *League of Legends*. The page includes basic animations and styles built with `CSS`, along with data fetching using `JavaScript` to retrieve champion information from an external `API`.

The project is also deployed using `GitHub Pages`.

You can check it out [here](https://angel-l-g.github.io/ChampionDex/), though it might be temporarily unavailable.
